# MeXiCo

MeXiCo is an esoteric programming language, and a *compiler* for the language with the same name, compiling source code to [DNS MX records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record). This also explains the name.

It's greatly inspired by [blinry](https://morr.cc)'s [legit](https://github.com/blinry/legit) project and [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), and is written in [go](https://golang.org).
This project was born and written on a boring railroad trip from Hamburg to Düsseldorf.

## Machine specification

Like some other esoteric programming languages, a MeXiCo machine has a storage of unlimited size, also called *infinite tape*, and a first-in-last-out stack. It's possible to read from and write to the tape with a movable *head*. This makes MeXiCo turing-complete.

## Design

As stated above, the source code of a MeXiCo program completely resides in MX records. The compiler ensures that generated MX records are RFC-conform. This means, it is possible to deliver *MeXiCo* source code over a DNS server of your choice, and, using the [time-to-live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) value, cache source code on a DNS resolver of your choice.

Like in the old [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) days, source code *lines* are defined by a number at the beginning of a line, sitting in the [Priority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record#MX_preference,_distance,_and_priority) value of the MX record. Lines which are not filled out are skipped. As a short explanation:

```
someprogram.esolang.mil		IN	MX	10 <line 10>
someprogram.esolang.mil		IN	MX	20 <line 20>
someprogram.esolang.mil		IN	MX	30 <line 30>
```

Due to the fact that the payload of a MX records needs to be a [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FQDN), every command is represented as a subdomain of the domain `mexico.invalid.`, which is obviously non-existent. If a command contains spaces, for example if they carry an argument (`push 5`), every space is replaced by a minus sign.

## Instructions

Below, you can find the instructions used in the MX records.

| Command | Involves | Consumes Stack | Pushes to Stack | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `left` | Tape Head | 0 | 0 | Moves the tape head one cell to the left |
| `right` | Tape Head | 0 | 0 |  Moves the tape head one cell to the right |
| `pusht` | Tape, Stack | 0 | 1 | Reads the current cell value and pushes it on top of the stack |
| `push n` | Stack | 0 | 1 | Pushes the value `n` to the stack |
| `pop` | Tape, Stack | 1 | 0 | Pops top stack value to the current cell |
| `dup` | Stack | 1 | 2 | Duplicates the topmost stack value |
| `del` | Stack | 1 | 0 | Deletes the topmost stack value, ignoring its value |
| `eq` | Stack | 2 | 1 | Checks if `stack[0] == stack[1]`. Pushes `1` to the stack if equal, `0` otherwise | 
| `not` | Stack | 1 | 1 | Inverses `stack[0]` |
| `gt` | Stack | 2 | 1 | Checks if `stack[0] > stack[1]`. Pushes `1` to the stack if greater, `0` otherwise |
| `lt` | Stack | 2 | 1 | Checks if `stack[0] < stack[1]`. Pushes `1` to the stack if smaller, `0` otherwise |
| `add` | Stack | 2 | 1 | Calculates `stack[0] + stack[1]`, and pushes the result to the stack |
| `sub` | Stack | 2 | 1 | Calculates `stack[0] - stack[1]`, and pushes the result to the stack |
| `mult` | Stack | 2 | 1 | Calculates `stack[0] * stack[1]`, and pushes the result to the stack |
| `div` | Stack | 2 | 1 | Calculates `stack[0] / stack[1]`, and pushes the result to the stack |
| `mod` | Stack | 2 | 1 | Calculates `stack[0] % stack[1]`, and pushes the result to the stack |
| `read` | Stack | 0 | 1 | Reads a character from the user, and pushes its char value to the stack |
| `print` | Stack | 1 | 0 | Prints `stack[0]` as a character |
| `jmp` | Program Flow, Stack | 1 | 0 | Jumps to the line number specified by `stack[0]` |
| `jmpc` | Program Flow, Stack | 2 | 0 | Jumps to the line number specified by `stack[0]`, if `stack[1]` is not `0`. |

Please note that `stack[0]` refers to the topmost stack value, and `stack[i]` refers to the i-th stack value.

## Source code

The syntax of the source code is strongly aligned with the Instructions table above. However, there's a bit of *syntactical sugar* to make programming in this language enjoyable. Take a look into the `examples` directory of this repository to get a basic idea of it.

### Comments

Every line starting with `#`, `//` or `;` is ignored by the compiler.

### Labels

You can define labels like this:

```
// This program reads a character from the user, and subtracts 1 from it, until it is zero.
read

// Let's loop here
LOOP:
push 1
sub 
push 0
lt
push LOOP
jmpc

// We're done!
```

As you can see, labels can be defined with a `:` after the label name, and it can be used as a value for `push`. At compile time, it is replaced with the corresponding line number.

## Implementations

There is a reference implementation for the compiler, `mexico`, and a reference implementation for the interpreter, `mexigo`. Both can be found in this repository.

### Compiler "mexico"

Simply run `go install github.com/maride/mexico/mexico@latest` to get the compiler.

The mexico compiler takes three arguments:

- `-input` to specify the source code file
- `-output` to specify the output path for the zonefile
- `-baseDomain`, the base domain to compile the source code for. This should be the domain you are planning to host the source code on.

For example. to compile the `Fibonacci.mxc` example for the domain `fibonacci.mxc.maride.cc`, you could use this command:

`./mexico --input ../examples/Fibonacci.mxc --output /srv/zones/fibonacci.mxc.maride.cc --baseDomain fibonacci.mxc.maride.cc`

If no problems occurred and the compiler didn't run into an issue, nothing is printed.

### Interpreter "mexigo"

Simply run `go get github.com/maride/mexico/mexigo` to get the interpreter.

The mexigo interpreter takes only one argument - the domain to execute:

`./mexigo fibonacci.mxc.maride.cc`

This will give you an output similar to this:

```
> $ ./mexigo fibonacci.mxc.maride.cc
mexigo - the reference interpreter for the mexico esolang!
See github.com/maride/mexico for further information.

## Examples

You can find examples in the `examples` directory of this repository.

I currently host the `Fibonacci.mxc` on `fibonacci.mxc.maride.cc`, means you can run it with `mexigo fibonacci.mxc.maride.cc`!

I challenge you to write more examples. ;)
